FeedlyBackgroundTab
===

Are you a power user on Feedly, but annoyed that the 'v' shortcut key opens articles in a focused tab?  This extension fixes that!

After installing this extension, when looking at an article in list view, simply press **;** and it will open in a new, background tab.

Want to change your shortcut key?  Simply visit the options page.
